        <h1>Motivation</h1>
      
        <p>Reverse-engineering how biological neural circuits process
        information is key to understanding human brain function, developing
        effective therapies for psychiatric and neurological disease, and
        designing powerful new computer architectures that can replicate the
        formidable information processing capabilities of biological brains. To
        achieve this goal, we must focus on a model organism capable of complex
        behavioral and information processing tasks whose brain structure is
        within reach of current computational technology and whose neural
        activity can be experimentally accessed.</p>
        <br />

        <h1>An Unprecedented Opportunity</h1>

        <p>The fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is capable of a range of
        complex nonreactive behaviors driven by multiple sensory
        modalities. Remarkably, these behaviors are governed by a brain
        comprising only ~ 10<sup>5</sup> neurons!  An extensive toolbox of
        powerful genetic manipulation techniques developed through years of
        fruit fly research enables the visualization of the fly's neural
        circuitry and analysis of how its structure relates to the fly's
        behavior. This toolbox has enabled researchers to characterize the fly's
        sensory mechanisms and shed light on the structure of its brain
        connectivity map, or connectome. 
          <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2810%2901522-8">Recent work</a> has revealed that the fly's
        connectome comprises 40 unique modular subdivisions called 
          <i>local processing units</i> (LPUs). Almost
        all of these modules have been found to correspond to anatomical regions
        of the fly brain associated with specific functional subsystems such as
        sensation and locomotion. LPUs can therefore be regarded as
        functional building blocks of the fly brain.</p>

        <p>The computational tractability and genetic accessibility of the fly
        brain have acquired increased importance in light of ongoing advances in
        parallel computing and electrophysiological techniques. Graphics
        Processing Units (GPUs) are a powerful and affordable commodity parallel
        computing technology whose steady improvement promises the computational
        power needed to test increasingly realistic neural circuit models of the
        scale of the fly brain. While the fly's tiny size has made the recording
        of neural activity from its brain challenging, innovative technologies
        developed at the <a href="http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu">Bionet Group</a>
        and elsewhere have made it possible to contemplate the obtaining of
        simultaneous recording from multiple neurons in the fly
        brain. Neuroscientists therefore have an unprecedented opportunity to
        leverage these developments to build powerful new models of the fly
        brain that are informed by hitherto inaccessible knowledge regarding its
        structure and function.</p>
        <br />

        <h1>An Open Scalable Platform for Fruit Fly Brain Emulation</h1>

        <p>The Neurokernel project aims to build an open software platform that
        can scalably leverage the power of multiple GPUs to emulate the entire
        fly brain. A key feature of the platform is its support for integrating
        models of LPUs into models of entire functional subsystems. Neurokernel
        defines a mandatory module interface for the communication of neuron
        state data between LPU model implementations. Connectivity patterns
        between any two LPUs are expressed independently both of other inter-LPU
        connectivity patterns and the internal connectivity of the LPUs
        themselves. Enforced LPU interoperability and the partitioning of the
        fly connectome into connections responsible for distributing data
        between processing modules and connections that are part of those
        modules enables individual LPU models or connectivity patterns to be
        improved or replaced without modification of other parts of a brain
        emulation. This design facilitates the collaborative development of
        whole-brain emulations by enabling the immediate interconnection of
        independently developed LPU models with compatible
        interfaces. Neurokernel's support for LPU model integration also enables
        exploration of brain functions that cannot be exclusively attributed to
        individual LPUs or brain subsystems.</p>

        <p>A major goal of Neurokernel is to enable fly brain models to be
        scaled up in computational complexity without necessitating their
        reimplementation. To this end, Neurokernel will provide APIs that expose
        the components required to implement and interconnect LPU models while
        abstracting away the underlying GPU-dependent code that implements them;
        this will also enable Neurokernel-based emulations to benefit from
        future improvements in GPU technology. Neurokernel will also provide a
        GPU resource management infrastructure that will enable brain emulations
        to take advantage of multiple GPUs depending upon their availability.</p>
        <br />

        <h1>Help Build a Fly Brain!</h1>
    
        <p>Building an accurate emulation of the fly brain is an
        interdisciplinary effort that requires data, algorithms, and insight
        from (but not limited to) the fields of neuroscience, computer science,
        and systems engineering. Researchers interested in working towards this
        goal are invited to join the Neurokernel project. The platform software
        is developed in Python (a powerful, high-level language that enjoys wide
        popularity in the computational neuroscience community) and CUDA
        (NVIDIA's C language extension for GPU programming). All design
        specifications, documentation, and code are <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">open-source</a>
