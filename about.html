              <h1>About Neurokernel</h1>
          </div>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>

          <p>Reverse-engineering how biological neural circuits process
          information is key to understanding human brain function, developing
          effective therapies for psychiatric and neurological disease, and
          designing powerful new computer architectures that can replicate the
          formidable information processing capabilities of biological brains. To
          achieve this goal, we must focus on a model organism capable of complex
          behavioral and information processing tasks whose brain structure is
          within reach of current computational technology and whose neural
          activity can be experimentally accessed.</p>
          
          <h2>An Unprecedented Opportunity</h2>

          <p>The fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is capable of a range of
          complex nonreactive behaviors driven by multiple sensory
          modalities. Remarkably, these behaviors are governed by a brain
          comprising only ~ 10<sup>5</sup> neurons!  An extensive toolbox of
          powerful genetic manipulation techniques developed through years of
          fruit fly research enables the visualization of the fly's neural
          circuitry and analysis of how its structure relates to the fly's
          behavior. This toolbox has enabled researchers to characterize the fly's
          sensory mechanisms and shed light on the structure of its brain
          connectivity map, or connectome. 
            <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2810%2901522-8">Recent work</a> has revealed that the fly's
          connectome comprises 40 unique modular subdivisions called 
            <i>local processing units</i> (LPUs). Almost
          all of these modules have been found to correspond to anatomical regions
          of the fly brain associated with specific functional subsystems such as
          sensation and locomotion. LPUs can therefore be regarded as
          functional building blocks of the fly brain.</p>

          <p>The computational tractability and genetic accessibility of the fly
          brain have acquired increased importance in light of ongoing advances in
          parallel computing and electrophysiological techniques. Graphics
          Processing Units (GPUs) are a powerful and affordable commodity parallel
          computing technology whose steady improvement promises the computational
          power needed to test increasingly realistic neural circuit models of the
          scale of the fly brain. While the fly's tiny size has made the recording
          of neural activity from its brain challenging, innovative technologies
          developed at the <a href="http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu">Bionet Group</a>
          and elsewhere have made it possible to contemplate the obtaining of
          simultaneous recording from multiple neurons in the fly
          brain. Neuroscientists therefore have an unprecedented opportunity to
          leverage these developments to build powerful new models of the fly
          brain that are informed by hitherto inaccessible knowledge regarding its
          structure and function.</p>

          <h2>An Open Scalable Platform for Fruit Fly Brain Emulation</h2>

          <p>The Neurokernel project aims to build an open software platform that
          can scalably leverage the power of multiple GPUs to emulate the entire
          fly brain. A key feature of the platform is its support for integrating
          models of LPUs into models of entire functional subsystems. Neurokernel
          defines a mandatory module interface for the communication of neuron
          state data between LPU model implementations. Connectivity patterns
          between any two LPUs are expressed independently both of other inter-LPU
          connectivity patterns and the internal connectivity of the LPUs
          themselves. Enforced LPU interoperability and the partitioning of the
          fly connectome into connections responsible for distributing data
          between processing modules and connections that are part of those
          modules enables individual LPU models or connectivity patterns to be
          improved or replaced without modification of other parts of a brain
          emulation. This design facilitates the collaborative development of
          whole-brain emulations by enabling the immediate interconnection of
          independently developed LPU models with compatible
          interfaces. Neurokernel's support for LPU model integration also enables
          exploration of brain functions that cannot be exclusively attributed to
          individual LPUs or brain subsystems.</p>

          <p>A major goal of Neurokernel is to enable fly brain models to be
          scaled up in computational complexity without necessitating their
          reimplementation. To this end, Neurokernel will provide APIs that expose
          the components required to implement and interconnect LPU models while
          abstracting away the underlying GPU-dependent code that implements them;
          this will also enable Neurokernel-based emulations to benefit from
          future improvements in GPU technology. Neurokernel will also provide a
          GPU resource management infrastructure that will enable brain emulations
          to take advantage of multiple GPUs depending upon their availability.</p>

          <h2>Help Build a Fly Brain!</h2>

          <p>Building an accurate emulation of the fly brain is an
          interdisciplinary effort that requires data, algorithms, and insight
          from (but not limited to) the fields of neuroscience, computer science,
          and systems engineering. Researchers interested in working towards this
          goal are invited to join the Neurokernel project. The platform software
          is developed in Python (a powerful, high-level language that enjoys wide
          popularity in the computational neuroscience community) and CUDA
          (NVIDIA's C language extension for GPU programming). All design
          specifications, documentation, and code are <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">open-source</a>
