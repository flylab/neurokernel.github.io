            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          </div>

          <h2>General Questions</h2>

          <h4>What is Neurokernel?</h4>
          
          <p>Neurokernel is an open software platform implemented in Python for the emulation
          and validation of fruit fly (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) brain models
          on multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).</p>
          
          <h4>Isn't Neurokernel just another neural circuit simulator?</h4>

          <p>In short, <i>no</i>!</p>

          <p>Successfully modeling the entire brain of even a relatively "simple" organism
          such as the fruit fly requires an architectural framework that goes beyond
          general-purpose neural circuit simulators. Such a framework</p>

          <ul>
          <li>must be directly informed by the functional organization of
          the fly brain,</li>
          <li>must provide a high-level programming model,</li>
          <li> must provide machinery needed to address the complexity of leveraging
          widely available commodity parallel computing resources in an efficient and
          scalable manner,</li>
          <li>ensure that the work of multiple independent researchers focusing on
          different parts of the fly brain remains interoperable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As a framework for successfully modeling the fly brain, Neurokernel
          must serve as an operating system <i>kernel</i> vis-a-vis models of the entire
          brain; just as an operating system must be able to <i>allocate
          computational resources</i> and serve as an <i>extended machine</i> that
          provides the services needed by software applications, so too must Neurokernel
          be able to allocate parallel computational resources (i.e., available GPUs) and
          provide the programmability (i.e., software interfaces and computational models)
          required by the constituent elements of a fly brain model.</p>

          <h4>Why does Neurokernel use GPUs rather than some other
          high-performance computing technology?</h4>

          <p>Developing a successful emulation of the fly brain is a nontrivial undertaking
          that requires the combined efforts of many researchers. To enable and facilitate
          this collaboration, a framework for developing and executing a fly brain model
          must make use of a hardware which is not only powerful but available to a wide
          range of researchers. There are a growing number of publications that
          demonstrate the ability of GPU-based spiking neural simulators
          (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2009.06.028">Nageswaran et al., 2009</a>,
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596678">Fidjeland et al., 2010</a>,
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-12-S1-P239">Nowotny et al., 2011</a>,
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2011.00019">Richert et al., 2011</a>,
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2276056">Minkovich et al., 2014</a>) to
          achieve near-real-time performance for networks of at least of the magnitude of
          the Drosophila brain (if not larger) and the possibility of increasing simulator
          performance for such networks with the intelligent use of multiple GPUs. In
          light of these developments and the documented increases in the speed,
          parallelism, and data transfer bandwidth exhibited by recent generations of GPU
          technology, clusters of GPUs appear to be the most suitable hardware substrate
          for developing a near-real-time model of the entire fly brain at the present
          time (2014).

          <h4>The fruit fly's brain is too simple. Isn't the mammalian/primate/human brain
          more interesting?</h4>

          <p>Although the brains of higher organisms can support a range of abilities that
	  go well beyond those of a fly, the number of neurons and synapses in even "simpler"
          mammals such as the mouse are several orders of magnitude higher than those in
          the fly and will hence require proportionally more computational horsepower to
          attack than will be available to most researchers in the forseeable future. By
          contrast, near-real-time simulations of neuronal networks of the magnitude of
          the fly brain using simple spiking neuron models are becoming possible (see
          above); it therefore seems that the already-rapid improvements in GPU technology
          will make emulation of the entire fly brain at biological time scales using
          biologically realistic complex neuron and synapse models achievable in
          the near future.

          <p>It's worth noting that despite obvious differences in size and complexity
          between the fly brain and those of more complex organisms such as mammals,
          researchers dating back to Cajal have observed common design principles in the
          structure of their sensory subsystems. Moreover, a surprising number of genes
          and proteins expressed in the mammalian brain are also conserved in the genome
          of the fruit fly; this suggests that insight obtained by focusing on
          <i>Drosophila</i> will prove useful in understanding the mammalian brain.</p>

	  <p>While it is tempting to consider scaling up the design of the
          Neurokernel from fruit flies to mice and primates, doing so at this time would
          be akin to scaling up the internal architecture of a novel computer architecture
          to a cluster of interconnected computers while still optimizing the first
          computer's architecture! Given how much more complex biological systems are in
          comparison to existing computer architectures, <a
              href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Knuth's warning against premature
              optimization</a> is at least as relevant to brain modeling as it is to designing a
          new computer architecture, operating system kernel, or network communication
          scheme.</p>

          <h4>The fruit fly's brain is far more complex than other model
          organisms. Why not focus on them instead?</h4>

          <p>Although emulation of the fly brain may superficially seem more daunting than
          developing models of the nervous systems of simpler organisms, there are reasons
          why the fly may be a preferable model organism. One major factor is the range of
          complex nonreactive behaviors exhibited by the fly that can be experimentally
          probed using a well-developed toolkit of powerful genetic techniques for
          manipulation of its neural circuitry. Moreover, an increasing number of powerful
          experimental methods have been developed for obtaining precise recordings of the
          fly's neuronal responses to stimuli that are not yet available for other
          organisms.</p>

          <h2>Neurokernel Architecture</h2>

          <h4>What are local processing units (LPUs) and why are they
          significant?</h4>

          <p>Determining how the brain's highly complex structure implements specific
          functions requires its decomposition into functional modules whose input-output
          relationships can be individually analyzed and whose interactions can be
          explained in terms of the groups of synaptic connections that exist between
          them. Analysis of the fruit fly connectome has revealed that its brain can be
          decomposed into fewer than 50 distinct neural circuits, most of which correspond
          to anatomically distinct regions in its brain.  These regions, or neuropils,
          include sensory processing structures such as the olfactory system's antennal
          lobe and the vision system's lamina and medulla, as well as higher level
          structures such as the protocerebral bridge that receive input from sensory
          modules. We refer to most of these modules as local processing units (LPUs)
          because they are characterized by unique populations of local neurons whose
          processes are restricted to each LPU. The fly brain also comprises modules known
          as hubs that contain no local neurons; they appear to serve as communication
          relays between different LPUs. In contrast to a purely anatomical subdivision,
          the decomposition of the brain into LPUs and hubs casts the problem of reverse
          engineering the brain as one of discovering the processing performed by each
          individual LPU and determining how specific patterns of axonal connectivity
          integrate them into functional subsystems.</p>

          <h4>What's the difference between synaptic and axonal connectivity
          patterns?</h4>

          <p>An LPU comprises two populations of neurons, i.e., its local neurons (which
          project exclusively to other neurons comprised by the LPU), and its projection
          neurons (which may also project to neurons in other LPUs). Additionally, all
          synaptic connections defined between an incoming axon and neurons within an LPU
          are deemed to be part of the LPU. Axonal connectivity patterns between LPUs
          refer to the existence of axons that project from one LPU to the input ports of
          another.</p>

          <h2>Using Neurokernel</h2>

          <h4>How do I download and install it?</h4>

          <p>See the installation instructions 
          <a href="https://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel/wiki/Installation">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>Are there any examples of how to use Neurokernel?</h4>

          <p>Yes! Take a look in the
          <a href="https://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel/tree/master/examples">examples</a> folder and 
          the corresponding <a href="http://neurokernel.github.io/docs.html">IPython notebooks</a>.
          These examples include partial models of the fly's olfactory and vision systems that are based upon 
          actual fly connectome data.</p>

          <h4>What neuron and synapse models does Neurokernel support?</h4>

          <p>Neurokernel currently provides sample implementations of a select
          number of neural component models and compatible synapse models; these
          include a spiking neuron model (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire), a graded
          potential neuron model (Morris-Lecar configured to not emit spikes)),
          alpha function synapses, and a conductance-based synaptic model. These
          components can be immediately configured via configuration files (see
          below). We expect to extend this set of primitives with additional
          components required by future LPU models.</p>

          <h4>Can Neurokernel load LPU models specified using formats such as
          NeuroML?</h4>

          <p>Neurokernel can currently load LPU models specified in
          <a href="http://www.gexf.net">GEXF</a>, a widely supported graph storage format that
          is compatible with a range of Python packages and tool
          formats. We are incorporating support for specification of neural models using
          an extension of NeuroML 2.0 called CircuitML that will afford users with
          additional features that facilitate the modular construction of LPU circuits. If
          you have a proposal for a model specification mechanism with other advantages,
          feel free to let us know!</p>

          <h4>Can Neurokernel's performance be improved?</h4>

          <p>Certainly.</p>

          <p>The design of traditional neuronal network simulations has been
          driven mostly by a desire to optimize performance. This is natural
          because many of the modeling parameters in these simulations (i.e.,
          neuron and synapse models, etc.) are assumed to remain fixed throughout
          model execution. While constant parameters will continue to figure in
          neural models, there is a need to place greater emphasis on
          programmability and validation of the I/O function of neural circuits in
          order to both enable computational neuroscientists to build upon the
          work of their peers and facilitate the improvement of fly brain models
          in light of new biological data.</p>

          <p>Focusing on programmability before performance can be understood as analogous to
          engineering complex systems such as the Linux kernel. Although the initial
          implementation of Linux provided similar performance to other operating systems
          available at the time, Linus Torvald's decisions to target a specific platform
          (i.e., commodity x86 computers) and enforce a specific development methodology
          (i.e., by means of a free software license) were instrumental in enabling the
          development of the kernel into a near-ubiquitous basis for high-performance
          operating systems.</p>

          <h2>How to Participate in Neurokernel Development</h2>

          <h4>What is an RFC and why are they important to Neurokernel's
          development?</h4>

          <p>First employed in the development of the Internet (see
          <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026">RFC 2026</a>) and used more recently in
          the development of the Python programming language (in the guise of
          <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/">Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)</a>),
          RFCs are design proposals of a complex system's major components that are made
          available to the system's developers and other interested parties in order to
          elicit feedback (or "comments"). Once published, an RFC may be superseded by a
          newer RFC that incorporates modifications made in response to feedback. This
          process enables RFCs to both serve as authoritative specifications of a system's
          design (if deemed acceptable) and an archive of that system's design
          development. All published Neurokernel RFCs are publicly available on the
          <a href="http://neurokernel.github.io/docs">project website</a>.</p>

          <p>Submitted RFCs must either be explicitly placed in the public domain or 
          released under the <a href="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/">Open Publication
            License</a>.</p>

          <h4>Can I submit an RFC? How do I go about it?</h4>

          <p>Yes! Contact the Neurokernel developers via the project mailing list to have
          your RFC reviewed and uploaded to the Neurokernel site.</p>

          <h4>I'm interested in modeling a certain LPU. Has it already been
            modeled?</h4>

          <p>A list of the LPUs and hubs in the fly brain with links to currently implemented
          models is available on the project
          <a href="https://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel/wiki/LPU-List">wiki</a>.</p>

          <h4>I've written a new Neurokernel-based LPU model. How can I share it?</h4>

          <p>Submit the model as a 
          <a href="http://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel/pulls">pull request</a>
          on GitHub and write an RFC describing details of the model.</p>

          <h4>I want to propose a Great New Feature for Neurokernel. How can I do
            so?</h4>

          <p>Feel free to moot your idea on the project mailing list. If the
          feature is nontrivial and cannot be described briefly, writing an RFC
          that clearly delineates the proposal would be very helpful.</p>

          <h4>I've written some new code for Neurokernel. How can I have it
          incorporated into the project's code base?</h4>

          <p>Submit your new code as a pull request or (if the code is relatively brief) an
          enhancement issue. Note that Neurokernel is developed under the 
          open-source <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD
